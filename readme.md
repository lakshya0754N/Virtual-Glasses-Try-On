# Virtual Glasses Try-On
This project is a virtual glasses try-on system. It is a web application that allows users to try on different glasses on their face. The system uses a webcam to capture the user's face and then superimposes the glasses on top of it. The user can then see how the glasses look on their face in real-time.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run the Flask application: `python3 main.py` in terminal from project directory
4. Open the web application in your browser on localhost.
